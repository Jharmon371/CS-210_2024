These 2 projects were in my CS-210 class. Project 3 was making a program that read a text file and displayed each
item that was sold at the store and displayed the amount of times it apeared in the text file. Project 1, was 
making a clock that displayed 12 and 24 hour times next to each other and incrementaited when you interacted with 
the menu. I made sure to keep well detailed comments throughout the programs to make sure that if I needed to go 
back to make a change I easily could. One thing I need to work on is making the code look neater by indenting and 
adding extra lines between sections of code. What challenged me most was working through errors and trying to 
figure out why something ran the way it did when I thought it should have ran in a different way.
